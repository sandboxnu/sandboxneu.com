Sandbox is Northeastern’s student led software consultancy that aims to unleash the power of student-driven software. We build solutions to accelerate research for scientists, as well as in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as [searchneu.com](https://searchneu.com) and [GraduateNU](https://graduatenu.com) (a tool to help students build a plan of study).

As a brand designer, you'll have the choice to work on the Sandbox brand or join the Oasis team to build out the Oasis brand identity from the ground up, creating materials for our website, social media, apparel, and posters. Additionally, you’ll be part of a rapidly growing student organization with an opportunity to leave a significant and lasting impact.

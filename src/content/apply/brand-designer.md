Sandbox is Northeastern’s student led software consultancy that aims to unleash the power of student-driven software. We build solutions to accelerate research for scientists, as well as in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as [searchneu.com](https://searchneu.com) and [GraduateNU](https://graduatenu.com) (a tool to help students build a plan of study).

As a brand designer in Sandbox, you’ll work with other brand designers, our Head of Brand, and our Events Director to continuously promote Sandbox and improve its public image. You’ll also get to collaborate with UX designers at Sandbox in weekly designer meetings and critiques. Whether we’re building for clients or for the Northeastern community as a whole, we have a strong focus on community and building projects to benefit it, which relies heavily on branding and marketing to increase and improve outreach!

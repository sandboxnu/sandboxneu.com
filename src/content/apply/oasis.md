Looking for a mentorship opportunity? Oasis is a recently-launched program that helps students new to the field of computer science make their project ideas into a reality. As an Oasis Mentor, you will be a mentor to one or more groups of the Oasis Accelerator program, where students form teams to work on their project ideas throughout 10 weeks. 

You will be expected to help your teams when they face difficulty (many participants don't have much experience with common web development technologies, for example), but also be able to let them work through some problems on their own to facilitate learning. You will also be tasked with keeping teams on task by creating and checking in with project roadmaps. 
Additionally, Oasis has great relationships with various student organizations at Northeastern, so joining the Oasis team is a great way to get involved in the broader Northeastern community!

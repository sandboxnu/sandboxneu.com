quote: "This was my first out-of-classroom experience being able to make some real stuff beyond the theoretical. And when I say real stuff, I mean getting to see it go from initial ideas to creating the wireframes and prototypes, to the final spec and to production and in use. I think that’s really rewarding and it pushes me to put my best foot forward."

Sandbox is Northeastern’s student led software consultancy that aims to unleash the power of student-driven software. Our clients are scientists in a wide range of disciplines, and we build solutions to accelerate their research. We also develop in-house tools for the Northeastern community, such as [searchneu.com](https://searchneu.com) and [GraduateNU](https://graduatenu.com) (a tool to help students build a plan of study).

We're looking for UX designers to design stunning user experiences for our projects. As a UX designer in Sandbox, you'll join a team of developers and a project lead to deliver a real application to production. Whether we're building for clients or for the Northeastern community as a whole, we have a strong focus on users. We conduct user interviews, create user personas, and many teams run weekly design meetings with the whole team.
